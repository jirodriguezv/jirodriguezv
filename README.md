- 👋 Hi, I’m Jose ignacio Rodriguez Valencia
👀 I’m interested in plant breeding, high-throughput phenotyping, and machine learning applications in crop improvement.
🌱 I’m currently a PhD student in Plant Breeding, focusing on the integration of high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) and machine learning to improve soybean adaptation and stability under different radiation environments.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on soybean adaptability, phenotypic stability analysis, genotype-by-environment interaction (GxE), and remote sensing for crop improvement.
